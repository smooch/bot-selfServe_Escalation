Setup/Integration:
- allow users to `register` their own app via a landing page
- serve static resources as attachments
- apply custom app Icon
- per app response customisation
- eliminate responses.json by using templates (?)
    - Then the landing page can also configure templates 

Behaviours:
- send welcome on `conversation:start`
- `postback` passthough doesn't open a new ticket (another message:appUser required)

What was this again?
- command: notify(channel, msg)
